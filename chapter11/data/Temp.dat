out 1
of 1

the 1

of 1
this 1

sets 1
you 1
most 1
rich 1
in 1
youth 1
before 1
my 1
sight 1
where 1
wasteful 1
time 1
debateth 1
with 1
decay 1
to 1
change 1
your 1
day 1
of 1

to 1
sullied 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
in 1
war 1
with 1
time 1
for 1
love 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
he 1
takes 1
from 1
you 1
i 1
engraft 1
you 1
new 1
but 1
wherefore 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
a 1
mightier 1
way 1
make 1
war 1
upon 1
this 1
bloody 1
tyrant 1
time 1
and 1
fortify 1
your 1
self 1
in 1
your 1
decay 1
with 1
means 1
more 1
blessed 1
than 1
my 1
barren 1
rhyme 1
now 1
stand 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
happy 1
hours 1
and 1
many 1
maiden 1
gardens 1
yet 1
unset 1
with 1
virtuous 1
wish 1
would 1
bear 1
you 1
living 1
flowers 1
much 1
liker 1
than 1
your 1
painted 1
counterfeit 1
so 1
should 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
life 1
repair 1
which 1
this 1
time's 1
pencil 1
or 1
my 1
pupil 1
pen 1
neither 1
in 1
inward 1
worth 1
nor 1
outward 1
fair 1
can 1
make 1
you 1
live 1
your 1
self 1
in 1
eyes 1
of 1
men 1
to 1
give 1
away 1
yourself 1
keeps 1
yourself 1
still 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
live 1
drawn 1
by 1
your 1
own 1
sweet 1
skill 1
who 1
will 1
believe 1
my 1
verse 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
your 1
most 1
high 1
deserts 1
though 1
yet 1
heaven 1
knows 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
tomb 1
which 1
hides 1
your 1
life 1
and 1
shows 1
not 1
half 1
your 1
parts 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
write 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
your 1
eyes 1
and 1
in 1
fresh 1
numbers 1
number 1
all 1
your 1
graces 1
the 1
age 1
to 1
come 1
would 1
say 1
'this 1
poet 1
lies 1
such 1
heavenly 1
touches 1
ne'er 1
touched 1
earthly 1
faces 1
' 1
so 1
should 1
my 1
papers 1
yellowed 1
with 1
their 1
age 1
be 1
scorned 1
like 1
old 1
men 1
of 1
less 1
truth 1
than 1
tongue 1
and 1
your 1
true 1
rights 1
be 1
termed 1
a 1
poet's 1
rage 1
and 1
stretched 1
metre 1
of 1
an 1
antique 1
song 1
but 1
were 1
some 1
child 1
of 1
yours 1
alive 1
that 1
time 1
you 1
should 1
live 1
twice 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
rhyme 1
shall 1
i 1
compare 1
thee 1
to 1
a 1
summer's 1
day 1
thou 1
art 1
more 1
lovely 1
and 1
more 1
temperate 1
rough 1
winds 1
do 1
shake 1
the 1
darling 1
buds 1
of 1
may 1
and 1
summer's 1
lease 1
hath 1
all 1
too 1
short 1
a 1
date 1
sometime 1
too 1
hot 1
the 1
eye 1
of 1
heaven 1
shines 1
and 1
often 1
is 1
his 1
gold 1
complexion 1
dimmed 1
and 1
every 1
fair 1
from 1
fair 1
sometime 1
declines 1
by 1
chance 1
or 1
nature's 1
changing 1
course 1
untrimmed 1
but 1
thy 1
eternal 1
summer 1
shall 1
not 1
fade 1
nor 1
lose 1
possession 1
of 1
that 1
fair 1
thou 1
ow'st 1
nor 1
shall 1
death 1
brag 1
thou 1
wander'st 1
in 1
his 1
shade 1
when 1
in 1
eternal 1
lines 1
to 1
time 1
thou 1
grow'st 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
men 1
can 1
breathe 1
or 1
eyes 1
can 1
see 1
so 1
long 1
lives 1
this 1
and 1
this 1
gives 1
life 1
to 1
thee 1
devouring 1
time 1
blunt 1
thou 1
the 1
lion's 1
paws 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
earth 1
devour 1
her 1
own 1
sweet 1
brood 1
pluck 1
the 1
keen 1
teeth 1
from 1
the 1
fierce 1
tiger's 1
jaws 1
and 1
burn 1
the 1
long-lived 1
phoenix 1
in 1
her 1
blood 1
make 1
glad 1
and 1
sorry 1
seasons 1
as 1
thou 1
fleet'st 1
and 1
do 1
whate'er 1
thou 1
wilt 1
swift-footed 1
time 1
to 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
all 1
her 1
fading 1
sweets 1
but 1
i 1
forbid 1
thee 1
one 1
most 1
heinous 1
crime 1
o 1
carve 1
not 1
with 1
thy 1
hours 1
my 1
love's 1
fair 1
brow 1
nor 1
draw 1
no 1
lines 1
there 1
with 1
thine 1
antique 1
pen 1
him 1
in 1
thy 1
course 1
untainted 1
do 1
allow 1
for 1
beauty's 1
pattern 1
to 1
succeeding 1
men 1
yet 1
do 1
thy 1
worst 1
old 1
time 1
despite 1
thy 1
wrong 1
my 1
love 1
shall 1
in 1
my 1
verse 1
ever 1
live 1
young 1
a 1
woman's 1
face 1
with 1
nature's 1
own 1
hand 1
painted 1
hast 1
thou 1
the 1
master 1
mistress 1
of 1
my 1
passion 1
a 1
woman's 1
gentle 1
heart 1
but 1
not 1
acquainted 1
with 1
shifting 1
change 1
as 1
is 1
false 1
women's 1
fashion 1
an 1
eye 1
more 1
bright 1
than 1
theirs 1
less 1
false 1
in 1
rolling 1
gilding 1
the 1
object 1
whereupon 1
it 1
gazeth 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
hue 1
all 1
hues 1
in 1
his 1
controlling 1
which 1
steals 1
men's 1
eyes 1
and 1
women's 1
souls 1
amazeth 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
woman 1
wert 1
thou 1
first 1
created 1
till 1
nature 1
as 1
she 1
wrought 1
thee 1
fell 1
a-doting 1
and 1
by 1
addition 1
me 1
of 1
thee 1
defeated 1
by 1
adding 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
my 1
purpose 1
nothing 1
but 1
since 1
she 1
prick'd 1
thee 1
out 1
for 1
women's 1
pleasure 1
mine 1
be 1
thy 1
love 1
and 1
thy 1
love's 1
use 1
their 1
treasure 1
so 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
with 1
me 1
as 1
with 1
that 1
muse 1
stirred 1
by 1
a 1
painted 1
beauty 1
to 1
his 1
verse 1
who 1
heaven 1
itself 1
for 1
ornament 1
doth 1
use 1
and 1
every 1
fair 1
with 1
his 1
fair 1
doth 1
rehearse 1
making 1
a 1
couplement 1
of 1
proud 1
compare 1
with 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
with 1
earth 1
and 1
sea's 1
rich 1
gems 1
with 1
april's 1
first-born 1
flowers 1
and 1
all 1
things 1
rare 1
that 1
heaven's 1
air 1
in 1
this 1
huge 1
rondure 1
hems 1
o 1
let 1
me 1
true 1
in 1
love 1
but 1
truly 1
write 1
and 1
then 1
believe 1
me 1
my 1
love 1
is 1
as 1
fair 1
as 1
any 1
mother's 1
child 1
though 1
not 1
so 1
bright 1
as 1
those 1
gold 1
candles 1
fixed 1
in 1
heaven's 1
air 1
let 1
them 1
say 1
more 1
that 1
like 1
of 1
hearsay 1
well 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
praise 1
that 1
purpose 1
not 1
to 1
sell 1
my 1
glass 1
shall 1
not 1
persuade 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
old 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
youth 1
and 1
thou 1
are 1
of 1
one 1
date 1
but 1
when 1
in 1
thee 1
time's 1
furrows 1
i 1
behold 1
then 1
look 1
i 1
death 1
my 1
days 1
should 1
expiate 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
beauty 1
that 1
doth 1
cover 1
thee 1
is 1
but 1
the 1
seemly 1
raiment 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
in 1
thy 1
breast 1
doth 1
live 1
as 1
thine 1
in 1
me 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
then 1
be 1
elder 1
than 1
thou 1
art 1
o 1
therefore 1
love 1
be 1
of 1
thyself 1
so 1
wary 1
as 1
i 1
not 1
for 1
myself 1
but 1
for 1
thee 1
will 1
bearing 1
thy 1
heart 1
which 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
so 1
chary 1
as 1
tender 1
nurse 1
her 1
babe 1
from 1
faring 1
ill 1
presume 1
not 1
on 1
thy 1
heart 1
when 1
mine 1
is 1
slain 1
thou 1
gav'st 1
me 1
thine 1
not 1
to 1
give 1
back 1
again 1
as 1
an 1
unperfect 1
actor 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
who 1
with 1
his 1
fear 1
is 1
put 1
beside 1
his 1
part 1
or 1
some 1
fierce 1
thing 1
replete 1
with 1
too 1
much 1
rage 1
whose 1
strength's 1
abundance 1
weakens 1
his 1
own 1
heart 1
so 1
i 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
trust 1
forget 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
perfect 1
ceremony 1
of 1
love's 1
rite 1
and 1
in 1
mine 1
own 1
love's 1
strength 1
seem 1
to 1
decay 1
o'ercharged 1
with 1
burthen 1
of 1
mine 1
own 1
love's 1
might 1
o 1
let 1
my 1
looks 1
be 1
then 1
the 1
eloquence 1
and 1
dumb 1
presagers 1
of 1
my 1
speaking 1
breast 1
who 1
plead 1
for 1
love 1
and 1
look 1
for 1
recompense 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
tongue 1
that 1
more 1
hath 1
more 1
express'd 1
o 1
learn 1
to 1
read 1
what 1
silent 1
love 1
hath 1
writ 1
to 1
hear 1
with 1
eyes 1
belongs 1
to 1
love's 1
fine 1
wit 1
mine 1
eye 1
hath 1
played 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
hath 1
steeled 1
thy 1
beauty's 1
form 1
in 1
table 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
my 1
body 1
is 1
the 1

wherein 1
'tis 1
held 1

that 1
is 1
best 1
painter's 1
art 1
for 1
through 1
the 1
painter 1
must 1
you 1
see 1
his 1
skill 1
to 1
find 1
where 1
your 1
true 1
image 1
pictured 1
lies 1
which 1
in 1
my 1
bosom's 1
shop 1
is 1
hanging 1
still 1
that 1
hath 1
his 1
windows 1
glazed 1
with 1
thine 1
eyes 1

good 1
turns 1

i 1

intend 1
a 1

to 1
thee 1

keep 1
my 1
drooping 1
eyelids 1
open 1
wide 1
looking 1
on 1
darkness 1
which 1
the 1

that 1
my 1

presents 1
thy 1
shadow 1
to 1
my 1
sightless 1

which 1
like 1

jewel 1
hung 1

lo 1
thus 1
by 1
day 1
my 1
limbs 1
by 1

for 1
thee 1

for 1
myself 1

in 1
happy 1

debarred 1

not 1

day 1
by 1

him 1

night 1

not 1

day 1

daily 1

doth 1
nightly 1
make 1
grief's 1
length 1
seem 1
stronger 1
when 1

with 1

with 1
my 1
bootless 1
cries 1

look 1
upon 1
myself 1
and 1
curse 1
my 1
fate 1

me 1
like 1
to 1
one 1
more 1
rich 1
in 1
hope 1

like 1
him 1
like 1
him 1
with 1
friends 1
possessed 1
desiring 1
this 1
man's 1
art 1
and 1
that 1
man's 1
scope 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
most 1
enjoy 1
contented 1
least 1
yet 1
in 1
these 1
thoughts 1
my 1
self 1
almost 1
despising 1
haply 1
i 1
think 1
on 1
thee 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
state 1
like 1
to 1
the 1
lark 1
at 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
arising 1
from 1
sullen 1
earth 1
sings 1
hymns 1
at 1
heaven's 1
gate 1
for 1
thy 1
sweet 1
love 1
remembered 1
such 1
wealth 1
brings 1
that 1
then 1
i 1
scorn 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
state 1
with 1
kings 1
when 1
to 1
the 1
sessions 1
of 1
sweet 1
silent 1
thought 1
i 1
summon 1
up 1
remembrance 1
of 1
things 1
past 1
i 1
sigh 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
many 1
a 1
thing 1
i 1
sought 1
and 1
with 1
old 1
woes 1
new 1
wail 1
my 1
dear 1
time's 1
waste 1
then 1
can 1
i 1
drown 1
an 1
eye 1
unused 1
to 1
flow 1
for 1
precious 1
friends 1
hid 1
in 1
death's 1
dateless 1
night 1
and 1
weep 1
afresh 1
love's 1
long 1
since 1
cancelled 1
woe 1
and 1
moan 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
many 1
a 1
vanished 1
sight 1
then 1
can 1
i 1
grieve 1
at 1
grievances 1
foregone 1
and 1
heavily 1
from 1
woe 1
to 1
woe 1
tell 1
o'er 1
the 1
sad 1
account 1
of 1
fore-bemoaned 1
moan 1
which 1
i 1
new 1
pay 1
as 1
if 1
not 1
paid 1
before 1

if 1
the 1

i 1

on 1
thee 1
dear 1
friend 1
all 1
losses 1
are 1
restor'd 1
and 1
sorrows 1

thy 1
bosom 1
is 1
endeared 1
with 1
all 1
hearts 1
which 1
i 1
by 1

parts 1

all 1
those 1

many 1
a 1
holy 1

obsequious 1
tear 1
hath 1
dear 1
religious 1
love 1
stol'n 1
from 1
mine 1
eye 1
as 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1

now 1

the 1
grave 1

buried 1
love 1
doth 1
live 1
hung 1
with 1
the 1
trophies 1

my 1
lovers 1
gone 1
who 1
all 1
their 1
parts 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
thee 1
did 1
give 1
that 1

thine 1

thou 1

all 1
the 1
all 1
of 1
me 1
if 1

my 1
well-contented 1
day 1
when 1
that 1
churl 1
death 1
my 1
bones 1
with 1
dust 1
shall 1
cover 1
and 1
shalt 1
by 1
fortune 1
once 1
more 1
re-survey 1
these 1
poor 1
rude 1
lines 1
of 1
thy 1
deceased 1
lover 1

them 1
with 1
the 1
bett'ring 1
of 1
the 1
time 1

though 1
they 1

kissing 1
with 1
golden 1

with 1
this 1
disgrace 1
even 1
so 1
my 1
sun 1
one 1
early 1
morn 1
did 1
shine 1
with 1
all 1
triumphant 1
splendour 1
on 1
my 1
brow 1

out 1

one 1
hour 1

staineth 1
why 1
didst 1
thou 1
promise 1
such 1
a 1
beauteous 1
day 1
and 1
make 1
me 1
travel 1
forth 1
without 1
my 1
cloak 1
to 1
let 1
base 1
clouds 1
o'ertake 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
way 1
hiding 1
thy 1
bravery 1
in 1
their 1
rotten 1
smoke 1
'tis 1
not 1
enough 1
that 1

no 1

such 1
a 1
salve 1

speak 1
that 1
heals 1
the 1

cures 1
not 1
the 1
disgrace 1
nor 1
can 1
thy 1
shame 1
give 1
physic 1

my 1

cross 1
ah 1

those 1
tears 1
are 1
pearl 1

sweet 1
hours 1
from 1

thee 1

thou 1

all 1

our 1
dear 1

lose 1
name 1
of 1
single 1
one 1
that 1
by 1
this 1

i 1
may 1

that 1
due 1
to 1
thee 1
which 1
thou 1
deserv'st 1
alone 1
o 1
absence 1
what 1
a 1
torment 1
wouldst 1
thou 1
prove 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
thy 1
sour 1
leisure 1
gave 1
sweet 1
leave 1
to 1
entertain 1
the 1
time 1
with 1
thoughts 1
of 1
love 1
which 1
time 1
and 1
thoughts 1
so 1
sweetly 1
doth 1
deceive 1
and 1
that 1
thou 1
teachest 1
how 1
to 1
make 1
one 1
twain 1
by 1
praising 1
him 1
here 1
who 1
doth 1
hence 1
remain 1

all 1
my 1
loves 1
my 1
love 1
yea 1
take 1
them 1
all 1
what 1
hast 1
thou 1
then 1
more 1
than 1
thou 1
hadst 1
before 1
no 1
love 1
my 1
love 1
that 1
thou 1
mayst 1
true 1
love 1
call 1
all 1
mine 1
was 1
thine 1
before 1
thou 1

this 1
more 1
then 1
if 1
for 1
my 1
love 1
thou 1
my 1
love 1
receivest 1
i 1
cannot 1
blame 1
thee 1

but 1
yet 1
be 1
blam'd 1
if 1
thou 1
thy 1
self 1
deceivest 1
by 1
wilful 1
taste 1
of 1
what 1
thyself 1
refusest 1
i 1
do 1
forgive 1
thy 1
robbery 1
gentle 1
thief 1
although 1
thou 1
steal 1
thee 1
all 1
my 1
poverty 1
and 1
yet 1
love 1
knows 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
greater 1
grief 1
to 1
bear 1
love's 1
wrong 1
than 1
hate's 1
known 1
injury 1
lascivious 1
grace 1
in 1
whom 1
all 1
ill 1
well 1
shows 1
kill 1
me 1
with 1
spites 1
yet 1
we 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
foes 1
those 1
pretty 1
wrongs 1
that 1
liberty 1
commits 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
sometime 1
absent 1
from 1
thy 1
heart 1
thy 1
beauty 1
and 1
thy 1
years 1
full 1
well 1
befits 1
for 1
still 1
temptation 1

where 1
thou 1
art 1
gentle 1
thou 1
art 1
and 1
therefore 1
to 1
be 1
won 1
beauteous 1
thou 1
art 1
therefore 1
to 1
be 1
assailed 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
woos 1
what 1
woman's 1
son 1
will 1
sourly 1
leave 1
her 1
till 1
he 1
have 1
prevailed 1
ay 1
me 1
but 1
yet 1
thou 1
mightst 1
my 1
seat 1
forbear 1
and 1
chide 1
thy 1
beauty 1
and 1
thy 1
straying 1
youth 1
who 1
lead 1
thee 1
in 1
their 1
riot 1
even 1
there 1
where 1
thou 1
art 1
forced 1
to 1
break 1
a 1
twofold 1
truth 1
hers 1
by 1
thy 1
beauty 1
tempting 1
her 1
to 1
thee 1
thine 1
by 1
thy 1
beauty 1
being 1
false 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
thou 1
hast 1
her 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
all 1
my 1
grief 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
dearly 1
that 1
she 1
hath 1
thee 1
is 1
of 1
my 1
wailing 1
chief 1
a 1
loss 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
touches 1
me 1
more 1
nearly 1
loving 1
offenders 1
thus 1
i 1
will 1
excuse 1
ye 1
thou 1
dost 1
love 1
her 1
because 1
thou 1
know'st 1
i 1
love 1
her 1
and 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
even 1
so 1
doth 1
she 1
abuse 1
me 1
suffering 1
my 1
friend 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
to 1
approve 1
her 1
if 1
i 1
lose 1
thee 1
my 1
loss 1
is 1
my 1
love's 1
gain 1
and 1
losing 1
her 1
my 1
friend 1
hath 1
found 1
that 1
loss 1
both 1
find 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
i 1
lose 1
both 1
twain 1
and 1
both 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
lay 1
on 1
me 1
this 1
cross 1
but 1
here's 1
the 1
joy 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
one 1
sweet 1
flattery 1
then 1
she 1
loves 1
but 1
me 1
alone 1
when 1
most 1
i 1
wink 1
then 1
do 1
mine 1
eyes 1
best 1
see 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
day 1
they 1
view 1
things 1
unrespected 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
sleep 1
in 1
dreams 1
they 1
look 1
on 1
thee 1
and 1
darkly 1
bright 1
are 1
bright 1
in 1
dark 1
directed 1
then 1
thou 1
whose 1
shadow 1
shadows 1
doth 1
make 1
bright 1
how 1
would 1
thy 1
shadow's 1
form 1
form 1
happy 1
show 1
to 1
the 1
clear 1
day 1
with 1
thy 1
much 1
clearer 1
light 1
when 1
to 1
unseeing 1
eyes 1
thy 1
shade 1
shines 1
so 1
how 1
would 1
i 1
say 1
mine 1
eyes 1
be 1
blessed 1
made 1
by 1
looking 1
on 1
thee 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
day 1
when 1
in 1
dead 1
night 1
thy 1
fair 1
imperfect 1
shade 1
through 1
heavy 1
sleep 1
on 1
sightless 1
eyes 1
doth 1
stay 1
all 1
days 1
are 1
nights 1
to 1
see 1
till 1
i 1
see 1
thee 1
and 1
nights 1
bright 1
days 1
when 1
dreams 1
do 1
show 1
thee 1
me 1
if 1
the 1
dull 1
substance 1
of 1
my 1
flesh 1
were 1
thought 1
injurious 1
distance 1
should 1
not 1
stop 1
my 1
way 1
for 1
then 1
despite 1
of 1
space 1
i 1
would 1
be 1
brought 1
from 1
limits 1
far 1
remote 1
where 1
thou 1
dost 1
stay 1
no 1
matter 1
then 1
although 1
my 1
foot 1
did 1
stand 1
upon 1
the 1
farthest 1
earth 1
removed 1
from 1
thee 1
for 1
nimble 1
thought 1
can 1
jump 1
both 1
sea 1
and 1
land 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
think 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
but 1
ah 1
thought 1
kills 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
thought 1
to 1
leap 1
large 1
lengths 1
of 1
miles 1
when 1
thou 1
art 1
gone 1
but 1
that 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
earth 1
and 1
water 1
wrought 1
i 1
must 1
attend 1
time's 1
leisure 1
with 1
my 1
moan 1
receiving 1
nought 1
by 1
elements 1
so 1
slow 1
but 1
heavy 1
tears 1
badges 1
of 1
either's 1
woe 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
slight 1
air 1
and 1
purging 1
fire 1
are 1
both 1
with 1
thee 1
wherever 1
i 1

the 1
first 1
my 1
thought 1
the 1
other 1
my 1

these 1
present-absent 1
with 1
swift 1
motion 1
slide 1
for 1
when 1
these 1
quicker 1
elements 1
are 1
gone 1
in 1
tender 1
embassy 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
thee 1
my 1
life 1
being 1
made 1
of 1
four 1
with 1
two 1
alone 1
sinks 1
down 1
to 1
death 1
oppressed 1
with 1
melancholy 1
until 1
life's 1
composition 1
be 1
recured 1
by 1
those 1
swift 1
messengers 1
return'd 1
from 1
thee 1
who 1
even 1
but 1
now 1
come 1
back 1
again 1
assured 1
of 1
thy 1
fair 1
health 1
recounting 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
told 1
i 1
joy 1
but 1
then 1
no 1
longer 1
glad 1
i 1
send 1
them 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
straight 1
grow 1
sad 1
mine 1
eye 1
and 1
heart 1
are 1
at 1
a 1
mortal 1
war 1
how 1
to 1
divide 1
the 1
conquest 1
of 1
thy 1
sight 1
mine 1
eye 1
my 1
heart 1
thy 1
picture's 1
sight 1
would 1
bar 1
my 1
heart 1
mine 1
eye 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
that 1
right 1
my 1
heart 1
doth 1
plead 1
that 1
thou 1
in 1
him 1
dost 1
lie 1
a 1
closet 1
never 1
pierced 1
with 1
crystal 1
eyes 1
but 1
the 1
defendant 1
doth 1
that 1
plea 1
deny 1
and 1
says 1
in 1
him 1
thy 1
fair 1
appearance 1
lies 1
to 1
'cide 1
this 1
title 1
is 1
impannelled 1
a 1
quest 1
of 1
thoughts 1
all 1
tenants 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
and 1
by 1
their 1
verdict 1
is 1
determined 1
the 1
clear 1
eye's 1
moiety 1
and 1
the 1
dear 1
heart's 1
part 1
as 1
thus 1
mine 1
eye's 1
due 1
is 1
thine 1
outward 1
part 1
and 1
my 1
heart's 1
right 1
thine 1
inward 1
love 1
of 1
heart 1
betwixt 1
mine 1
eye 1

a 1
league 1
is 1
took 1
and 1
each 1
doth 1
good 1
turns 1
now 1
unto 1
the 1
other 1
when 1
that 1
mine 1

is 1
famish'd 1
for 1
a 1
look 1
or 1
heart 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
sighs 1
himself 1
doth 1
smother 1
with 1
my 1
love's 1
picture 1
then 1
my 1
eye 1
doth 1
feast 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
painted 1
banquet 1
bids 1
my 1
heart 1
another 1
time 1
mine 1
eye 1
is 1
my 1
heart's 1
guest 1

in 1
his 1

come 1

take 1
my 1

away 1
this 1

a 1
death 1

it 1

lose 1
since 1
brass 1

sad 1
mortality 1
o'er-sways 1

power 1
how 1
with 1
this 1
rage 1
shall 1
beauty 1
hold 1
a 1
plea 1
whose 1
action 1
is 1
no 1
stronger 1
than 1
a 1
flower 1

summer's 1
honey 1
breath 1
hold 1
out 1
against 1
the 1
wreckful 1
siege 1

thine 1

this 1

why 1

thou 1

blamed 1
shall 1
not 1

ever 1

the 1

so 1
thou 1

thou 1

owe 1
no 1

mourn 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
i 1

not 1

let 1
your 1

world 1
should 1
task 1
you 1
to 1
recite 1
what 1
merit 1
lived 1
in 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
love 1
after 1
my 1
death 1
dear 1
love 1
forget 1
me 1
quite 1
for 1
you 1
in 1
me 1
can 1
nothing 1
worthy 1
prove 1
unless 1
you 1
would 1
devise 1
some 1
virtuous 1
lie 1
to 1
do 1
more 1
for 1
me 1
than 1
mine 1
own 1
desert 1
and 1
hang 1
more 1
praise 1
upon 1
deceased 1
i 1
than 1
niggard 1
truth 1
would 1
willingly 1
impart 1
o 1
lest 1
your 1
true 1
love 1
may 1
seem 1
false 1
in 1
this 1
that 1
you 1
for 1
love 1
speak 1
well 1
of 1
me 1
untrue 1
my 1
name 1
be 1
buried 1
where 1
my 1
body 1
is 1
and 1
live 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
shame 1
nor 1
me 1
nor 1
you 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
shamed 1
by 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
bring 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
should 1
you 1
to 1
love 1
things 1
nothing 1
worth 1
that 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
thou 1
mayst 1
in 1
me 1
behold 1
when 1
yellow 1
leaves 1
or 1
none 1
or 1
few 1
do 1
hang 1
upon 1
those 1
boughs 1
which 1
shake 1
against 1
the 1
cold 1
bare 1
ruin'd 1
choirs 1
where 1
late 1
the 1
sweet 1
birds 1
sang 1
in 1
me 1
thou 1
seest 1
the 1
twilight 1
of 1
such 1
day 1
as 1
after 1
sunset 1
fadeth 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
which 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
black 1
night 1
doth 1
take 1
away 1
death's 1
second 1
self 1
that 1
seals 1
up 1
all 1
in 1
rest 1
in 1
me 1
thou 1
see'st 1
the 1
glowing 1
of 1
such 1
fire 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
his 1
youth 1
doth 1
lie 1
as 1
the 1
death-bed 1
whereon 1
it 1
must 1
expire 1
consumed 1
with 1
that 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
nourish'd 1
by 1
this 1
thou 1
perceivest 1
which 1
makes 1
thy 1
love 1
more 1
strong 1
to 1
love 1
that 1
well 1
which 1
thou 1
must 1
leave 1
ere 1
long 1
but 1
be 1
contented 1
when 1
that 1
fell 1
arrest 1
without 1
all 1
bail 1
shall 1
carry 1
me 1
away 1
my 1
life 1
hath 1
in 1
this 1
line 1
some 1
interest 1
which 1
for 1
memorial 1
still 1
with 1
thee 1
shall 1
stay 1
when 1
thou 1
reviewest 1
this 1
thou 1
dost 1
review 1
the 1
very 1
part 1
was 1
consecrate 1
to 1
thee 1
the 1
earth 1
can 1
have 1
but 1
earth 1
which 1
is 1
his 1
due 1
my 1
spirit 1
is 1
thine 1
the 1
better 1
part 1
of 1
me 1
so 1
then 1
thou 1
hast 1
but 1
lost 1
the 1
dregs 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
worms 1
my 1
body 1
being 1
dead 1
the 1
coward 1
conquest 1
of 1
a 1
wretch's 1
knife 1
too 1
base 1
of 1
thee 1
to 1
be 1
remembered 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
which 1
it 1
contains 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
this 1
and 1
this 1
with 1
thee 1
remains 1
so 1
are 1
you 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
as 1
food 1
to 1
life 1
or 1
as 1
sweet-season'd 1
showers 1
are 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
peace 1
of 1
you 1
i 1
hold 1
such 1
strife 1
as 1
'twixt 1
a 1
miser 1
and 1
his 1
wealth 1
is 1
found 1
now 1
proud 1
as 1
an 1
enjoyer 1
and 1
anon 1
doubting 1
the 1
filching 1
age 1
will 1
steal 1
his 1
treasure 1
now 1
counting 1
best 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
alone 1
then 1
better'd 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
may 1
see 1
my 1
pleasure 1
sometime 1
all 1
full 1
with 1
feasting 1
on 1
your 1
sight 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
clean 1
starved 1
for 1
a 1
look 1
possessing 1
or 1
pursuing 1
no 1
delight 1
save 1
what 1
is 1
had 1
or 1
must 1
from 1
you 1
be 1
took 1
thus 1
do 1
i 1
pine 1
and 1
surfeit 1
day 1
by 1
day 1
or 1
gluttoning 1
on 1
all 1
or 1
all 1
away 1
why 1
is 1
my 1
verse 1
so 1
barren 1
of 1
new 1
pride 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
variation 1
or 1
quick 1
change 1
why 1
with 1
the 1
time 1
do 1
i 1
not 1
glance 1
aside 1
to 1
new-found 1
methods 1
and 1
to 1
compounds 1
strange 1
why 1
write 1
i 1
still 1
all 1
one 1
ever 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
keep 1
invention 1
in 1
a 1
noted 1
weed 1
that 1
every 1
word 1
doth 1
almost 1
tell 1
my 1
name 1
showing 1
their 1
birth 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
did 1
proceed 1
o 1
know 1
sweet 1
love 1
i 1
always 1
write 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
and 1
love 1
are 1
still 1
my 1
argument 1
so 1
all 1
my 1
best 1
is 1
dressing 1
old 1
words 1
new 1
spending 1
again 1
what 1
is 1
already 1
spent 1
for 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
daily 1
new 1
and 1
old 1
so 1
is 1
my 1
love 1
still 1
telling 1
what 1
is 1
told 1
thy 1
glass 1
will 1
show 1
thee 1
how 1
thy 1
beauties 1
wear 1
thy 1
dial 1
how 1
thy 1
precious 1
minutes 1
waste 1
the 1
vacant 1
leaves 1
thy 1
mind's 1
imprint 1
will 1
bear 1
and 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
this 1
learning 1
mayst 1
thou 1
taste 1
the 1
wrinkles 1
which 1
thy 1
glass 1
will 1
truly 1
show 1
of 1
mouthed 1
graves 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
memory 1
thou 1
by 1
thy 1
dial's 1
shady 1
stealth 1
mayst 1
know 1
time's 1
thievish 1
progress 1
to 1
eternity 1
look 1
what 1
thy 1
memory 1
can 1
not 1
contain 1
commit 1
to 1
these 1
waste 1
blanks 1
and 1
thou 1
shalt 1
find 1
those 1
children 1
nursed 1
deliver'd 1
from 1
thy 1
brain 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
new 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
thy 1
mind 1
these 1
offices 1
so 1
oft 1
as 1
thou 1
wilt 1
look 1
shall 1
profit 1
thee 1
and 1
much 1
enrich 1
thy 1
book 1
so 1
oft 1
have 1
i 1
invoked 1
thee 1
for 1
my 1
muse 1
and 1
found 1
such 1
fair 1
assistance 1
in 1
my 1
verse 1
as 1
every 1
alien 1
pen 1
hath 1
got 1
my 1
use 1
and 1
under 1
thee 1
their 1
poesy 1
disperse 1
thine 1
eyes 1
that 1
taught 1
the 1
dumb 1
on 1
high 1
to 1
sing 1
and 1
heavy 1
ignorance 1
aloft 1
to 1
fly 1
have 1
added 1
feathers 1
to 1
the 1
learned's 1
wing 1
and 1
given 1
grace 1
a 1
double 1
majesty 1
yet 1
be 1
most 1
proud 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
compile 1
whose 1
influence 1
is 1
thine 1
and 1
born 1
of 1
thee 1
in 1
others' 1
works 1
thou 1
dost 1
but 1
mend 1
the 1
style 1
and 1
arts 1
with 1
thy 1
sweet 1
graces 1
graced 1
be 1
but 1
thou 1
art 1
all 1
my 1
art 1
and 1
dost 1
advance 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
learning 1
my 1
rude 1
ignorance 1
whilst 1
i 1
alone 1
did 1
call 1
upon 1
thy 1
aid 1
my 1
verse 1
alone 1
had 1
all 1
thy 1
gentle 1
grace 1
but 1
now 1
my 1
gracious 1
numbers 1
are 1
decay'd 1
and 1
my 1
sick 1
muse 1
doth 1
give 1
another 1
place 1
i 1
grant 1
sweet 1
love 1
thy 1
lovely 1
argument 1
deserves 1
the 1
travail 1
of 1
a 1
worthier 1
pen 1
yet 1
what 1
of 1
thee 1
thy 1
poet 1
doth 1
invent 1
he 1
robs 1
thee 1
of 1
and 1
pays 1
it 1
thee 1
again 1
he 1
lends 1
thee 1
virtue 1
and 1
he 1
stole 1
that 1
word 1
from 1
thy 1
behavior 1
beauty 1
doth 1
he 1
give 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
in 1
thy 1
cheek 1
he 1
can 1
afford 1
no 1
praise 1
to 1
thee 1
but 1
what 1
in 1
thee 1
doth 1
live 1
then 1
thank 1
him 1
not 1
for 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
doth 1
say 1
since 1
what 1
he 1
owes 1
thee 1
thou 1
thyself 1
dost 1
pay 1
o 1
how 1
i 1
faint 1
when 1
i 1
of 1
you 1
do 1
write 1
knowing 1
a 1
better 1
spirit 1
doth 1
use 1
your 1
name 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
praise 1
thereof 1
spends 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
tongue-tied 1
speaking 1
of 1
your 1
fame 1
but 1
since 1
your 1
worth 1
wide 1
as 1
the 1
ocean 1
is 1
the 1
humble 1
as 1
the 1
proudest 1
sail 1
doth 1
bear 1
my 1
saucy 1
bark 1
inferior 1
far 1
to 1
his 1
on 1
your 1
broad 1
main 1
doth 1
wilfully 1
appear 1
your 1
shallowest 1
help 1
will 1
hold 1
me 1
up 1
afloat 1
whilst 1
he 1
upon 1
your 1
soundless 1
deep 1
doth 1
ride 1
or 1
being 1
wreck'd 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
worthless 1
boat 1
he 1
of 1
tall 1
building 1
and 1
of 1
goodly 1
pride 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
thrive 1
and 1
i 1
be 1
cast 1
away 1
the 1
worst 1
was 1
this 1
my 1
love 1
was 1
my 1
decay 1
